Walking beside me,
Heaven's own shadow falls.
For they know not the answers
No light to where they are told.

Did I hear a whisper?
Did I hear your cry?
For it pulled me onwards
From the earth facing the skies.

And in my dreams,
They'll hold me on towards tomorrow,
Not knowing what,
Not knowing where I'll go.

I put my trust,
Into the hand that leads me,
I follow him,
Over the lands and sea.

Dreaming of the days,
When I'll know what to call and,
The days when I'll know a name.
Dreaming of the days,
When the lights that guided me,
Become everlasting flames.

Dreaming of the days,
Dreaming of the days.

And in my dreams,
They'll hold me on towards tomorrow,
Not know what,
Not knowing where I'll go.

I put my trust,
Into the hand that leads me.
I follow him,
Over the lands and sea.

Dreaming of the days,
When I'll know what to call and,
The days when I'll know a name.
Dreaming of the days,
When the lights that guided me,
Become everlasting flames.

Dreaming of the days,
Dreaming of the days.

Ahhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh

Dreaming of the days,
Dreaming of the days,
Dreaming of the days,
Dreaming of the days
